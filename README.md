# Twitch Filter Server
Server for Twitch Platform Filter

Uses [Twitch Platform Filter](https://github.com/peppercat10/twitch-platform-filter) to periodically refresh the filtered games.

Was previously deployed at https://twitch-platform-filter.herokuapp.com/, but that is no longer the case as Heroku has lost its Free tier.
